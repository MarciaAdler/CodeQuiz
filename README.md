# CodeQuiz

## User Story:

As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Business Context
Being on top of the fundamentals of JavaScript and being able to answer questions regarding the fundamentals quickly is key to mastering it.  A quiz testing me and my classmates on the fundamentals where we need to think quickly and respond with the right answer can help us master the fundamentals of JavaScript and also be able to see who among our peers have mastered it, so we can leverage them to help others.
